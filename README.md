## Java Notes

---

These notes contain code from GoalKicker.com's free book, Java Notes for Professionals (https://books.goalkicker.com/JavaBook/). 

Summaries of the code are contained in the comments. The Main class is intended as a natural starting point for the notes.
There will be methods in the Main class intended as separate topics (may be separated into classes later on.)
